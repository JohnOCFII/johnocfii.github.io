## Practice and XYZ Probe

Once the MilkCr8 was substantially built, the obvious question is -- what's next?  For me, that meant starting the journey to replace the 3D printed parts of the motion system with parts machined from 6061 aluminum -- parts that I'd machine myself ON THE MILKCr8!  How cool is that?  RepRap Spirit lives!

I'm an airplane pilot. One common tool we use all the times is a checklist.  Old timers often look at newer pilots and mutter under their breath, "What do you need _that_ for -- just kick the tires and light the fire!"  It wouldn't surprise me if long-time machinists have the same point of view.  To me as a rank beginner, I was crying out for a checklist!  There are **so many things** to remember, even _after_ the design is complete, and tool paths have been generated.  You need to:

- Mount the Stock
- Install the collet
- Install the end mill
- Confirm the starting position in X, Y, and Z

And that is for a simple operation.  Changing tools, or flipping a workpiece requires even more steps.  Get one wrong, and you might be starting over.

I decided to purchase an XYZ Touch Probe to help with accurate setting of X, Y, and Z.  I bought the [OpenBuilds XYZ Touch Probe] (https://openbuildspartstore.com/xyz-touch-probe-plus/) It does what it claims to do, but it works best on large flat pieces of stock.  Here's a photo of the XYZ probe in a nifty 3D printed mount: ![XYZ Touch Probe](/assets/images/XYZ_Probe.jpeg)
