## Now We're Smokin'

Once the bed was in place, I attached the lead-nut for X axis.  Y-axis leadnut was installed just before I bolted down the bed.

Next up was attaching the spindle mount to the tram plate, then attaching the tram plate to the spindle plate.  I had trouble with one of the M5 bolts.  Turns out, I had installed one of the lock nuts backwards!  This required some disassembly and re-assembly.  Oh well.

Before attaching the top of the MilkCr8 frame, I decided to attach some LED lights to the inside of the top.  I thought I had more longer strips, but ended up soldering two small strips together with some wires.  It's not perfect, but it'll do for now.

After that, I installed the door frame printed parts and test-fit the door.  I did remove the door after the test fit for the rest of the assembly process.

Finally - a photo looking up at the installed lights.
