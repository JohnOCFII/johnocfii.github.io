## Installing and Leveling the SpoilBoard

The MilkCr8 CNC uses an aluminum bed on the Y-Axis.  While you could machine directly on the bed, there is value in installing a sacrificial surface on top of that bed.  A common term for that surface is **spoilboard.**. I installed an MDF spoilboard using painters tape and CA glue.  In addition to having a surface that you can machine into, the spoilboard also gives you a chance to level the spoilboard surface to match that of the router/spindle as it travels across the X-axis.

Following the lead of @DreadMakerAdam, I purchased a [Sweepy 2.0](https://shop.carbide3d.com/collections/accessories/products/sweepy-2-0-dust-boot?variant=32975720972349) from Carbide3D.
