## Leveling the SpoilBoard

 A cutting device removes material from a piece of stock to reveal the intended object.  The cutting is not a quiet process.  Along with noise, the removal process creates sawdust, or chips of the removed material.  Unless you want your MilkCr8 to be full of chips and/or sawdust all the time, it's best to setup a system to remove sawdust/chips as you are machining.
