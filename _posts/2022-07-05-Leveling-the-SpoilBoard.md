## Installing and Leveling the SpoilBoard

The MilkCr8 CNC uses an aluminum bed on the Y-Axis.  While you could machine directly on the bed, there is value in installing a sacrificial surface on top of that bed.  A common term for that surface is **spoilboard**. I installed an MDF spoilboard using painters tape and CA glue.

In addition to having a surface that you can machine into, the spoilboard also gives you a chance to level the spoilboard surface to match that of the router/spindle as it travels across the X-axis.
