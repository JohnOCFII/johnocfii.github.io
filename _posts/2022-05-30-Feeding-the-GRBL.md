## Feeding the GRBL

Remember, the whole point of this journey is to be able to get a machine to do what you want it to do.  That's the whole Computer-Numerical-Control thing, commonly abbreviated CNC.  What many of us forget is that we are NOT building a machine that'll do what we WANT it to do -- instead, we're build a machine that'll do what we TELL it to do.  When we start to snap endmills like last week's pretzel, it is becuase we really DID tell the machine to dive sideways at rapid speed, instead of gently dipping our proverbial endmill toes into the water (aluminum).  

All our hopes and dreams are converted to GCODE.  There are many different ways to get GCODE from your CAM software to your machine.  Our MilkCr8 designer Joe suggested the OpenBuilds BlackBox controller, and while no one would mistake the BlackBox for the "latest hotness" here in 2022, it is an excellent choice for a project just as the MilkCr8.  It is well documented, proven, and comes with really decent software to control the machine called OpenBuilds CONTROL.
