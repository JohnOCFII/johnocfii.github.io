## Dust Extraction - CNC is not a white glove experience

I have a few years experience with 3D printing.  As an additive manufacturing technique, 3D printing is a clean and relatively quiet process involving heating up and extruding thin lines of plastic layer upon layer upon layer.  

CNC milling is a subtractive process.  A cutting device removes material from a piece of stock to reveal the intended object.  The cutting is not a quiet process.  Along with noise, the removal process creates sawdust, or chips of the removed material.  Unless you want your MilkCr8 to be full of chips and/or sawdust all the time, it's best to setup a system to remove sawdust/chips as you are machining.

Following the lead of @DreadMakerAdam, I purchased a [Sweepy 2.0](https://shop.carbide3d.com/collections/accessories/products/sweepy-2-0-dust-boot?variant=32975720972349) from Carbide3D. 

While there are all sorts of 3D printed options, this kit was clean and simple, and got high marks from Adam amd others.

For a hose, I purchased this 10 foot 1-3/16" O.D. hose.  [Fulton Hose Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M27BN5Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).
