## Uh Oh - Bed No Go!

The hard stuff was done, right?  Now all I have to do is line up 4 carriages, screw them up, then line up four more bolts for the lead-screw holder, and move on to the next step?  Right?  Right?  Wrong.

Turns out, after I screwed in the carriages on the left Y-axis rail, none of the holes on the right side rail would line up!  I was crushed!  Turns out, likely due to enough transfer punching or center punching errors, the two Y linear rails were about 0.5 to 0.7mm too close together!  I was thinking about re-printing the Y-steel holders, or other more time consuming meausures, and then Stephanie-Lah from the Discord suggested I swap front to back on one or both of the Y-steel units!  While it took a little disassembly, this worked great, and with much less re-work than the other options I was considering!
