## Amp It Up!

I'll let you in on a little secret.  I LOVE the wiring and electronics part of these hobby projects!  Everything from cable management, to figuring out wire lengths, to crimping connectors, testing continuity with a multimeter, and finally, flipping that power switch and bringing everything to life!

I started by stealing ideas, as one does, from the photos provided by Joe and Adam.  I printed (on paper) a mockup of the IOT relay, as I hadn't yet received it, and wanted to make sure I could position components appropriately.  I bought a new sheet of acrylic, and used my jigsaw to cut out the board to similar dimensions to that used by Adam and Joe.  Hot tip: slow down your jigsaw, otherwise the heat will seal up the cut as soon as you've gone past it!
