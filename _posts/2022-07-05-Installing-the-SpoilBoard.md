## Installing the SpoilBoard

The MilkCr8 CNC uses an aluminum bed on the Y-Axis.  While you could machine directly on the bed, there is value in installing a sacrificial surface on top of that bed.  A common term for that surface is **spoilboard**. I installed an MDF spoilboard using painters tape and CA glue.

In the future, I plan to create a spoilboard that has embedded threaded nuts to allow different methods of workholding to hold stock to the spoilboard.
