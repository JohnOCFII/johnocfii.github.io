## Adventures in (Bed) Drilling

Next step - drill 20 holes in the aluminum bed...easy peasy, right? ;)

After drilling and tapping 64 holes in the steel, and seeing how easy it was to make sub-1mm mistakes that caused real problems, I wanted to make sure I did a better job with the aluminum bed.  In my favor, this time, I had only 20 holes, and the material was aluminum.  Running against me was the fact that alignment for all holes was pretty critical.  Unlike with mounting the linear rails to the steel, I couldn't skip a couple.  These all had to work.

Given the criticality of straight, well-aligned holes, I decided I needed to enlist the help of a friend with a drill press!
