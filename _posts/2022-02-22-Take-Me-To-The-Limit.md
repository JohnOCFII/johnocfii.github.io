## Take Me to the Limit (Switches)

Once the XZ plate was attached to the X-axis steel (and moving smoothly) it was time for a little glory photo.  Unfortunately, that photo showed me that I had forgotten to shorten the Z-axis leadscrew to 200mm.

Thankfully, my trusty angle grinder and cutoff wheel was able to make quick work of that unneeded length.  After cutting off the end, I used the grinding wheel followed by some manual filing to clean out the grooves.

One angle I wanted to show was the back-side of the XZ-plate with the X-leadnut attached.  This was a bit unclear to me in the assembly guide, so here is that photo.
