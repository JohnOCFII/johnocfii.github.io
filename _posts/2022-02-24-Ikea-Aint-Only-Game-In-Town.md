## Ikea Ain't the Only Game in Town

Now that I had some of the internals figured out, it was time to find a place to put them.  Oh yeah, that's the whole **point** of the MilkCr8!  At this point, I was really, really glad I had asked Joe to cut the frame for me.  Assembly was really straightforward!  There was some jiggling of dowels requred, and a couple of holes needed to be "convinced" with a little drilling action, but overall, the assembly went smoothly, and really started to look like I was going to finish this thing!
