## Making it go Round 'n Round

Once the XZ plate was attached to the X-axis steel (and moving smoothly) it was time for a little glory photo.  
Unfortunately, that photo showed me that I had forgotten to shorten the Z-axis leadscrew to 200mm.  

After the X and Y axis steel assemblies were installed into the wooden MilkC8 crate, it was time to set up the leadscrews for X and Y.  Unlike the Z-axis, which has a stepper motor with an integrated leadscrew, the X and Y axis required a leadscrew to be attached to the stepper motor spindles.  The assembly was familiar to me, as I've used it when assembling 3D printers.  A flexible coupler is used to join the 5mm diameter stepper motor shaft to the 8mm diameter leadscrews.
