## A first look at the MilkCr8 CNC Components

I could buckle down, finish cleaning the basement, set up my new workbench, and get started building the MilkCr8, but where is the fun in that? So, instead, I've taken a few pictures of the items in the Bill of Materials (BOM) for your enjoyment.

- First up: The MilkCr8 frame.  Joe was kind enough to sell me one of his CNC cut frames.  He also included the acrylic door, which I just realized isn't in the picture.  It is clear acrylic, so you can just pretend it is in the shot.  I've sprayed the frame with multiple coats of clear Polyurethane spray.

- Next up are the steel and aluminum components.  The steel makes up the X and Y axes of the machine.  My steel arrived a bit too long, so I used my angle grinder with grinding wheel to trim them to the proper length.  In the six weeks I had the steel in my basement, I started to pick up some surface rust, so I once again turned to the angle grinder with a different abrasive disc to remove the rust and prepare the steel for cleaning and painting with Rust-oleum.  The steel is shown with the linear rail alignment jigs.

Also shown is the aluminum bed material, and "spare" aluminum which -- if I'm successful, can be cut on the MilkCr8 to make key components for the Z-axis, replacing the originally 3D printed pieces.
