## A first look at the MilkCr8 CNC Components

I could buckle down, finish cleaning the basement, set up my new workbench, and get started building the MilkCr8, but where is the fun in that? So, instead, I've taken a few pictures of the items in the Bill of Materials (BOM) for your enjoyment.

- First up: The MilkCr8 frame.  Joe was kind enough to sell me one of his CNC cut frames.  He also included the acrylic door, which I just realized isn't in the picture.  It is clear acrylic, so you can just pretend it is in the shot.  I've sprayed the frame with multiple coats of clear Polyurethane spray.
