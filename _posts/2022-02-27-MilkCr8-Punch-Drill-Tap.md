## Why Steel?

I _finally_ finished cleaning and organizing the basement! That let me set up my new workbench and get started building the MilkCr8.

One of the goals of a subtractive CNC machine is rigidity.  If you are going to have quickly spinning things trying to cut their way through metals, you want it to move crisply and precisely, not wiggle around like a drunken drill bit.  To that end, Joe chose steel as the core of the X and Y axis for the MilkCr8.

Turns out, my three steel components were too long.  Better too long than too short, I guess.  I was able to use an angle grinder to get them to the correct length without too much hassle.

After cutting to the proper length, I decided to paint the steel for protection from the elements.  Fall was in full swing, and I wanted to get these painted outside and dried in the garage before it got too cold.  The painting area in the back yard sort of looked like the scene from carefully planned murder.

I also sprayed the wood frame (the MilkCr8) with acrylic as well.  I left these to dry in the garage for two weeks before moving them into the house.

This was the last work I'd do for 10 weeks until I got the basement cleaned!
