## Why Steel?

I _finally_ finished cleaning and organizing the basement! That let me set up my new workbench and get started building the MilkCr8.

One of the goals of a subtractive CNC machine is rigidity.  If you are going to have quickly spinning things trying to cut their way through metals, you want it to move crisply and precisely, not wiggle around like a drunken drill bit.  To that end, Joe chose steel as the core of the X and Y axis for the MilkCr8.

One of the first steps after preparing your steel is to attach the linear rails.  Before you can bolt the rails into the steel, you need to have a place for the bolts to go!  

- Use the jigs to align the rails on the steel
- Use a transfer punch and the punch jig to mark the center of each of the holes in the linear rail
- Remove the linear rail from the steel and use a center punch to increase the size of each mark from the transfer punch.  The goal of this step is to make a small divot so that when drilling, the drill stays in the planned hole, and doesn't slide around the steel, which could move the hole to a place where it can't be used.

- Joe was kind enough to sell me one of his CNC cut frames.  He also included the acrylic door, which I just realized isn't in the picture.  It is clear acrylic, so you can just pretend it is in the shot.  I've sprayed the frame with multiple coats of clear Polyurethane spray.

And -- that's it (as far as I know -- other than endstops...).  I'm sure I'll get photos of the printed parts as I make them.  If you have questions, please let me know!
